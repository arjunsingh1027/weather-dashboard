# weather-dashboard

This weather dashboard uses the Open Weather free API to pull weather on cities around the world.

If a user wanted to plan a trip, they could use this weather dashboard to see the current temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index along with a 5 day forecast. 

For this homework I used JQuery, boostrap, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
